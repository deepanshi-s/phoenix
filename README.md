Prediction and management of floods

PREDICTION-
The app uses data from India Meteorological Department(IMD) and sends timely warnings to the users about the possible occurence of a flood.
We plan to use data from IMD and google maps to find out the places above the predicted flood levels and guiding people through AR to the nearest safe spots.

OCCURENCE-
The app will have a distress button which when pressed will send the pre-registered aadhar number and the current location of the user to the server using gps with wireless mesh technology in case the user has no access to internet during calamity.
This ensure the evacuation of most of the people.

MANAGEMENT-
The aadhar number can be used to get more details about the person and contact the family members.
The app will have a section devoted to nearby shelter homes which can be reached with google maps.
Another part of it will have information regarding present location of registered users which will help the user to reach out the family members.
The complete medical bio data of the user will also be in stored in the app's database so the proper medications can be given to him.

FUTURE PLAN-
In cases where the disaster might occur at night or a person is not able to respond to the warnings and notifictions within a predetermined time frame, then a copy of his fingerprint/iris or aadhar number is automatically sent to the nearest safety shelter which can be processed using aadhar database to get more information and evacuate people.
